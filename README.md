This is my first ground-up project in React, made for a Mobile Web Design course at Asheville-Buncombe Technical College. I drew assistance from tutorials by Roy Villalobos and Stephen Grider.  It does not currently have a back-end but I hope to expand to full-stack as I learn back-end tools.

Product description:
Virtual Magnet is an app that allows employees or members of a team, company, organization, or group to quickly and frequently update a status that others can view live.  This enables others in the group to access information on membersâ€™ whereabouts, how to contact, when to expect them back, etc., and gives all members the ability to view and update this information remotely from anywhere.  For industries and functions that involve work across many locations with possibly erratic schedules, this will facilitate communication and accountability and make management and collaboration easier.  Essentially, it replaces the workplace white board in/out magnets with something that can be updated and viewed remotely.  This is especially appropriate for fields/functions that do not necessarily involve work on a computer most of the time, and need a solution that is simple and compact to provide just this one needed function.  This product would be customized and provided to user groups on a subscription basis.
